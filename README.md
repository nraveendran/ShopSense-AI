Shop Sense – AI-Powered Shopping Assistant
Shop Sense is an AI-powered app that helps users make smarter shopping decisions by turning scanned receipts into conversational insights. The app uses intelligent receipt parsing, natural language understanding, and voice-first design to make shopping simpler, smarter, and more personal.

Whether you're trying to save money, stay organized, or just remember what you bought, Shop Sense delivers value through everyday prompts like:

🧾 “How much did I spend on dog food last month?”
🛒 “What do I usually buy every week?”
🥚 “Did I already buy milk and eggs this week?”
📝 “Make me a shopping list for this week.”
💰 “What store gave me the best deals last month?”

🧠 Coming Soon: Smarter Savings & Deal Integration

I’m currently working on personalized savings suggestions into the app. This will allow users to:

Automatically match their frequent purchases with local or online deals
Get weekly "smart savings reports"
Plan shopping runs based on real-time discounts

🔬 Advanced Prompts (In Progress)
As the platform evolves, I'm building support for more sophisticated user requests like:

“Compare my grocery spending in summer vs winter over the past 2 years.”
“How much could I save if I switched to store-brand versions of the things I buy?”
“Remind me what I bought last time I cooked for friends.”
“Just show me the cheapest place to buy everything on my list.”
“Can you remind me if I already bought things for Sunday dinner?”https://github.com/nraveendran 🔍 Shop Sense – AI-Powere
